### Arithmetic Progression - Create A Function that Takes:

#### Difficulty - Very Easy 

1. **First Number** of the **Sequence**, **Constant Difference** between the **Numbers** and **Total Numbers** in the **Sequence** as an arguments.
1. Shows the **First n Numbers** of the **Argument Sequence** with the **Argument Difference** in the **Console**.

> arithmeticProgression(23, 1, 5) ➞ "23, 24, 25, 26, 27"  

> arithmeticProgression(17, -5, 23) ➞ "17, 12, 7, 2, -3, -8, -13, -18, -23, -28, -33, -38, -43, -48, -53, -58, -63, -68, -73, -78, -83, -88, -93" 

> arithmeticProgression(16, 10, 20) ➞ "16, 26, 36, 46, 56, 66, 76, 86, 96, 106, 116, 126, 136, 146, 156, 166, 176, 186, 196, 206"

Note: 
1. In **Mathematics**, An **Arithmetic Progression (AP)** is **A Sequence** of **Numbers** such that the **Difference Between** the **Consecutive Terms** is **Constant**.
1. The **Final Result** should be **A String** of **Numbers**, **Separated** by **Comma** and **Space**.
