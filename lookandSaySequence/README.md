### Look-And-Say Sequence - Create a function that takes: 

1. A **Term (As String)** as an argument. 
1. Shows the **Next Term** of the **Sequence** in the console.

> nextTerm("2211121221233312333") ➞ "2231121122111233111233" 

> nextTerm("11222332121221") ➞ "213223121112112211"

> nextTerm("312311233321") ➞ "131112132112331211"

Note :
1. The **Look-And-Say Sequence** is generated by describing **Each Group** of **Identical Digits** in the **Previous Term**.
1. **Terms** should only **Include** the **Digits 1, 2, and 3**.
