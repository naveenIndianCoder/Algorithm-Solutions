### Is Making Progress ? - Create a function that takes: 

1. An **Array** of **Miles Run Every Friday** as an argument. 
1. Shows **Total Number** of **Progress Days** in the console.

> howManyProgressDays([3, 7, 2, 5, 9, 1, 0]) ➞ 3 

> howManyProgressDays([6, 2, 6, 5, 7, 9, 10]) ➞ 4

> howManyProgressDays([3, 4, 10, 8, 8]) ➞ 2

Note :
1. If current **Friday Exceeds** the **Number** of **Miles Run** the previous friday, **Then** this is called a **Progress Day**.
1. Running the **Same Number** of **Miles** as last week **Does Not Count** as a **Progress Day**.
