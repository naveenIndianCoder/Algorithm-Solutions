### Multiplicity of Numbers - Create a function that takes: 

1. An **Array** of **Numbers** as an argument. 
1. Shows an **Array** of **Sub - Arrays** in the console, in **Each Sub - Array** contains argument array's **Each Number** and **Number Of Times** it **Occurred** in the argument array.

> multiplicityNum([23, 44, 66, 23, 66, 23, 23, 2, 6]) ➞ [[23,4], [44, 1], [66, 2], [2, 1], [6, 1]] 

> multiplicityNum([30, 4, 2, 4, 30 ,4, 2,]) ➞ [[30, 2], [4, 3], [2, 2]]

> multiplicityNum([26, 7, 19, 96, 26, 26 , 7 ,7, 7 ,7]) ➞ [[26, 3], [7, 5], [19, 1], [96, 1]]
